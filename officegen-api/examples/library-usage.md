This guide details the setup, installation, and usage process of this NPM package within your projects.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before proceeding:
- Node.js (v12.x or higher recommended)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

## Installation

This package is available on the NPM registry. To install it, simply run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install @hlexnc/document-conversion-solutions --save
```

## Setting Up Your Project

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project** (if not already done) by executing `npm init` in your project directory and completing the setup prompts.

2. **Install the Document Conversion Solutions Library** with the command mentioned in the Installation section.

## Usage

Import the library into your Node.js application, configure your document structure and styles in JSON, and invoke the library function to create a document.

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating the library usage:

```javascript
const documentLibrary = require('@hlexnc/document-conversion-solutions');

// Define your document structure and styles
const inputJson = {
  "elements": [
    { "type": "title", "text": "Document Title" },
    { "type": "subtitle", "text": "Subtitle Here" },
    { "type": "paragraph", "text": "This is a simple paragraph." },
    {
      "type": "list",
      "items": ["First item", "Second item", "Third item"]
    }
  ],
  "styles": {
    "fontFamily": {
      "title": "Arial",
      "body": "Calibri"
    },
    "textColor": "#000000"
  }
};

// Create the document
documentLibrary.createDocumentWithStructure(inputJson)
  .then((path) => console.log(`Document created at: ${path}`))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error creating document:', error));
```

### Error Handling

It's crucial to implement error handling in your application to manage any potential issues, such as invalid inputs or problems during document generation.

## Advanced Usage

For creating more complex documents, consult the `officegen` documentation to familiarize yourself with the full spectrum of supported elements and styles. The Document Conversion Solutions Library accommodates these configurations through the `inputJson` structure.
