# Document Conversion Code Snippets üìÑüîÑ

Welcome to the Document Conversion Code Snippets repository! This is a comprehensive collection of JavaScript/TypeScript and Python code snippets designed to aid developers in converting documents between various formats, notably from Markdown to Google Docs, Word, PowerPoint, and other popular formats.

## Why This Repository? ü§î

During my year working at the [@UniversityOfNicosia](https://github.com/UniversityOfNicosia), I encountered multiple document conversion challenges. This repository emerged from the necessity to provide developers with a respite from such challenges, granting open-source access to a variety of beneficial code snippets I've assembled over time.

## Options for Document Conversion

We offer two primary options for document conversion:

### 1. JavaScript/TypeScript for Next.js

This option is ideal for developers looking to implement document conversion within a Next.js application. It includes snippets for converting Markdown to HTML, Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), and Google Docs format.

- **Get Started**: Navigate to the [document-conversion README](https://github.com/HlexNC/Document-Conversion-Snippets/blob/feature/104-docker/document-conversion/README.md) for setup instructions and more details.

### 2. Python API

For those who prefer working with Python, this API provides a straightforward way to convert documents. It includes a setup for a virtual environment, dependency management, and instructions for installing Pandoc, a crucial tool for document conversion.

- **Get Started**: Check out the [python-api README](https://github.com/HlexNC/Document-Conversion-Snippets/blob/feature/104-docker/python-api/README.md) for setup instructions and further information.

## Important Notice üìú
