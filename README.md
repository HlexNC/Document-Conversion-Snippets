# Document Conversion Code Snippets 📄🔄

Welcome to the Document Conversion Code Snippets repository! This is a collection of JavaScript/TypeScript code snippets designed to inspire and assist developers who need to convert documents between various formats. 

## Why This Repository? 🤔

During my year working for the University Of Nicosia, I had to create a few document conversion solutions. However, I found a lot of difficulty finding any pre-existing JavaScript solutions online. To save my fellow developers from repeating the same struggle, I decided to open-source a collection of my code snippets. 

Thus, this repository was born! 🎉

The functions are written in TypeScript (for Next.JS), but can easily be rewritten for a Node.JS environment. Feel free to implement these code snippets directly into your project, or use them as a jumping-off point to create a solution that suits your unique needs.

## Contained Code Snippets 

- `convertMarkdownToHtml`: Converts markdown to HTML using `highlight.js` and `markdown-it`.
- `exportToDocx`: Converts markdown to the old Word document format using `convertMarkdownToHtml`.
- `exportToPptx`: Converts markdown to a .pptx file using `pptxgenjs` and `convertMarkdownToHtml`.

## Important Notice 📜

While I am happy to share these code snippets with the developer community, I kindly request that if you use or adapt these snippets in your own projects, you give appropriate credit to the original creator.

Remember, in open source contribution, _respect and recognition is better than 'ctrl+c' and 'ctrl+v'._

## Contributing 🧑‍💻

If you come across any challenges or find an improvement, I'd appreciate it if you could contribute to this repository by submitting a pull request or opening an issue. Together, we can make this an invaluable resource for the developer community!

Happy coding! 🚀💻
